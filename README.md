## New mechanics and personal assets
I want to add new mechanics to get a feel for basic game desing principles and Unity functionality. Also I will be using assets that I drew on my Ipad for basically everything in the game. This will basically be my playground to mess around with any feature new to me that can add some spice to the game.
